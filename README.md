# Laravel Searchable

**This package is in early development stages, breaking changes likely to occur.**

Easy search-engine-like searches for Laravel using MySQL FULLTEXT search features.

The goal of this package is to make it easy to implement a search engine feature 
with Eloquent and MySQL alone. 

A popular approach is to use something like Laravel Scout and third party libraries 
like Lucene or Solar as the search engine, but I would say that is overkill for 
most projects.

MySQL itself has nice FULLTEXT search features, but that's not integrated into 
Eloquent and that's where this package comes in.
