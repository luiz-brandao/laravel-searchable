# Laravel Searchable

**This package is in early development stages, breaking changes likely to occur.**

The goal of this package is to make it easy to implement a search engine feature 
with Eloquent and MySQL alone using MySQL FULLTEXT search features.

A popular approach when implementing search features is to use something like 
Laravel Scout and third party libraries like Lucene and Solr as the search engine, 
but I would say that is overkill for most projects.

MySQL itself has nice FULLTEXT search features that are not integrated into 
Eloquent and that's where this package comes in.
